          <p>One warm afternoon, a hungry fox was walking slowly through the forest. The sun was shining, and the air was hot. The fox had been looking for food all morning, but he found nothing to eat. His stomach growled loudly, and he was becoming tired.</p>

          <p>As he walked, the fox suddenly saw a vineyard near the forest path. On the vines, he noticed many bunches of grapes hanging. The grapes looked big, round, purple, and very juicy. At once, the fox felt excited. “Ah, finally, something delicious for me!” he said to himself. He imagined the sweet taste of the grapes in his mouth.</p>

          <p>The fox stood under the vine and opened his mouth wide, but the grapes were too high. He jumped once, but he missed. He jumped again, trying harder, but still he could not reach them. The fox did not give up quickly. He walked back a few steps, ran forward, and leapt as high as he could. Again, the grapes were far above him.</p>

          <p>He tried many times, again and again. The fox stretched his body, stood on his back legs, and even tried to climb a little, but it was useless. Sweat began to fall from his face, and his legs grew weaker. The grapes still hung high, shining in the sun.</p>

          <p>Finally, the fox stopped. He sat under the vine, breathing heavily. He looked up at the grapes with tired eyes. After a moment, he shook his head and said, “Those grapes are probably sour. I don’t want them anymore.” Then, he slowly walked away, still hungry and disappointed.</p>
