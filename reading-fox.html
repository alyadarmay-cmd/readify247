          <p>
            One warm afternoon, a fox was walking slowly through the forest. The sun was shining, 
            and the fox was very hungry. He had searched for food all morning, but he could not 
            find anything to eat. His stomach growled, and he wished he could find something delicious.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, he noticed a vineyard not far away. On the vines, he saw many bunches of grapes. 
            They looked round, purple, and very juicy. The fox’s mouth began to water. 
            “Ah, finally, some food for me!” he said. He imagined how sweet the grapes would taste.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fox stood under the grapes and tried to reach them with his mouth, but they were too high. 
            He jumped as high as he could, but he missed. He tried again, jumping higher, but he still 
            could not reach the grapes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fox did not give up at once. He walked back a few steps, ran forward quickly, and leapt 
            with all his strength. Still, the grapes were far above him. He tried again and again. 
            His legs became weak, and sweat ran down his face.
          </p>

          <p>
            After many tries, the fox was very tired. He sat down on the ground to rest. He looked up 
            at the grapes and sighed. Finally, he shook his head and said, 
            “Those grapes are probably sour. I don’t want them anymore.” 
            Then he turned around and walked away slowly, still hungry.
